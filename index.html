      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>After separating from the United States Navy on October 6, 2018, I wanted a career thay was challenging, interesting and rewarding. 
         I see myself becoming a web developer as my entry point into the tech industry. 
         It's facinating that from a laptop and a few programming languages, web developers have the ability to take ideas and 
         actually create web applications that can be life changing.
